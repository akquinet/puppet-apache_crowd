puppet-apache_crowd

This is the puppet-apache_crowd module.
It is an implementation of the atlassian apache crowd connector guidelines:
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD020/Integrating+Crowd+with+Apache
plus
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD024/Installing+the+Crowd+Apache+Connector+on+Red+Hat+Enterprise+Linux

This implementation uses the older standard because it supports both Crowd 
versions smaller and greater than 2.0. The new standard only supports Crowd 
versions greater than 2.0 (see last point listed at: 
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD024/Integrating+Crowd+with+Apache#IntegratingCrowdwithApache-Step6.ConfiguringSubversion%28Optional%29 ).

Because this module installs several packages from a zip archive you must include
https://github.com/akquinet/puppet-unzip.git as a module and place an
"include unzip" or "class { "unzip" : }" in your recipe.  

Example usage in combination with the example42/puppet-apache module
(https://github.com/example42/puppet-apache):
